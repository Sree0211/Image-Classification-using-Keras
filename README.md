# Image-Classification-using-Keras

This project aims to develop an image classification model using Keras to distinguish between images of dogs and images of wolves. Image classification is a fundamental task in computer vision, and this project showcases how to build, train, and evaluate a deep learning model to perform this classification task.

Dataset
The dataset for this project consists of labeled images of dogs and wolves. You can use your own dataset or obtain one from publicly available sources such as Kaggle. Ensure that the dataset is split into training, validation, and testing sets.

The image classification model consists of a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture. The CNN extracts features from the input images and learns to differentiate between dogs and wolves. The architecture can be customized by modifying the model's structure and hyperparameters in ImageClass_keras.ipynb file.
